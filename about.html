            <h1>Mental Health Awareness</h1>
            <p style="font-size: x-large">We live in a world that often glorifies perfection, where we're expected to always be strong, happy, and successful. But the truth is, it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to feel sad, anxious, or overwhelmed. It's okay to need help.
                Mental health is just as important as physical health. Yet, for too long, it has been stigmatized and ignored. We need to break the silence and start talking about mental health.</p>
